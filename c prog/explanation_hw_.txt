Explanation: ln = line number

ln  1: include standard input/output header
ln  2: inlucde ctype header to use tolower() to convert a character into lowercase
ln  3: include standard lib for exit() function -> case 3
ln  5: we declare two variables c and confirmation.
       c            = to enter a character to check for vowel or Consonant
       confirmation = to ask user to enter y for yes or n for no, to run the program again
ln  6: we declare two integer variable choice and number.
       choice = users choice used in switch function
       number = to store number that we will check for even or Odd
ln  7: line number 7 to 11 we simply print the menu and ask user's choice
ln 13: based on user choice value switch statement is executed
ln 14: line number 14 to line 21
       we ask user to enter a number and check whether it's even or odd.
       even number is when a number is divided by 2 and yields a remainder 0.
ln 22: don't forget the break statement.
ln 23: line number 23 to 33
       We ask user to enter a character, we convert the character to lower case
       and check if it's a vowel or consonant.
ln 34: line number 34 to 35
       if user enter choice as 3 then we exit
ln 37: line number 37 and 39 that is for default statement.
ln 41: line number 41 and 42
       we ask user if they want to run the program again.
       the confirmation value is converted to lowercase and check if it's equal to 'y'
       it means yes, run the loop or else it terminates.
